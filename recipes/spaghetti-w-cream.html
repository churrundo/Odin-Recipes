        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the first pasta I learned to cook, and it's very difficult to get wrong</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200g spaghetti</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of diced onion</li>
            <li>5 strips of bacon, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp of butter</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp of salt</li>
            <li>ground pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of parsley, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with water and add the pasta when it gets to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>While the water boils, melt the butter on a saucepan. Add the onion, the garlic, and the bacon, and cook until the bacon is crispy.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta to the water pot and let it cook. Try single pieces occasionally to check if it's ready (you can throw them at a window. If they stick, they're ready).</li>
            <li>Continue stirring the bacon and add the cream and the milk. Add the salt and pepper and let the flavors integrate.</li>
            <li>Strain the pasta. Add the parsley to the sauce and give it a final stir.</li>
            <li>Pour the sauce into the pasta and serve with grated parmesan on top.</li>
        </ol>

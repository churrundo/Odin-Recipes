        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>From <i>The New Cookbook for Poor Poets</i>:</p>
        <p><en>The bon vivant of scandinavia chews cardamom seeds as a breath sweetener. Ground and made into cookies, the seeds loose a share of their cleansing effect. However, these cookies are exceedingly refreshing, as well as quite crisp.</en></p>

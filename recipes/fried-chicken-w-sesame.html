                <li>4 pounds of chicken, cut for frying</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat the egg and mil together. Dip chiken pieces into this and then into the flour mixed with baking powder, salt, pepper, paprika, nuts and sesame seeds.</li>
